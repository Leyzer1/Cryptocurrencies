# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview

In this challenege we are asked to create a report about crytocurrencies and how they can be grouped to create classification system. To analyze the data we got from CryptoCompare we will be using unsupervised machine learning. We will process the data, cluster it, reduce dimensions, and reduce principal components using PCA. We then use vizualizations to view our results.


# Results

**Finding the Best Value for k Using the Elbow Curve:**

**3D-Scatter with Clusters**
We cleaned the data to only show the actively trading crytocurrencies which left us with 532 different cryptocurrencies.
From there we grouped and created a 3D graphs to vizualize it.

**HVPLOT.Scatter plot**
We then created a 2D scatter plot to comapre Total Coins Mained vs Total Coins Supply.
